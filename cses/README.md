## CSES

This code was from approximately late 2020 when I got interested in competative programming. I read the competative programmer's handbook (https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
and wanted to learn about competative programming.

So these are about 50 of the solutions to the CSES problemset (https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) problems.
